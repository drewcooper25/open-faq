            <div id="purpose" style="display: none;">
            <p>We want to find out if the use of do-it-yourself artificial pancreas systems (DIYAPS; open source loop systems) has an influence on the health and well-being of people with diabetes. Additionally, we want to examine the challenges associated with building DIYAPS, and why some people choose not to use DIYAPS. </p>

            <p>We are very sorry but it is not possible to participate on behalf of your child if they are younger than 2 years old. This is because certain questionnaires are not available for children this young.</p>

            <p>We want you to participate anonymously. If you have read the information sheet and decided to take part in our survey, you will first be given a participant ID which guarantees your anonymity in the survey.</p>
            <p>In case you decide to also join Open Humans and link your account to us, we can contact you anonymously without accessing any of your personal information on Open Humans.</p>

            <div id="survey_time" style="display: none;">
            <p>The time needed to complete the survey depends on the type of participant. We have several short questionnaires for you which should take approximately 30 minutes to complete. You can always have a break and come back to where you left off in the questionnaires. For this you will need your participant ID.</p>

            <p>The protection of your identity and data is very important to us. Our study is under the General Data Protection Guidelines (GDPR) mandated by the EU, ensuring maximum protection and personal control for participants over their information. As such, in order to keep you anonymous we do not ask for your real name, but generate a Participant ID.</p>
            <p>We ask you to write down, take a picture or email your Participant ID to yourself and keep it safe. You <strong>will</strong> need it later.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>We kindly invite you to complete the survey we have prepared.</li>
                <li>Once you have completed the survey, if you would like to be personally informed about follow-up studies, we can message you without re-identifying you if you have an <strong>account on Open Humans</strong> and link it to our project. We have a How-to explanation here (link) on our website and within our survey.</li>
                <li>If you are interested in helping us <strong>take our research to the next level</strong> by combining your answers from the survey questionnaires with your health-related data, you can also “fill” your account on Open Humans with your CGM data and provide us access (see How-to below).</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Attention:</strong> Every time you upload new data you have to link your account with the OPEN project again if you want us to use the new data for our research.</p>
            <p>Uploading data to Open Humans can be done in several ways. This will be thoroughly explained at the survey and here (link) on our website.</p>

            <p>First of all, the protection of your data is  ….</p>
            <p>For this, it is important to know that you have to differentiate between the two different data sets that you can provide us with:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The data we get from your answers at the survey questionnaires and the CGM/loop device data you share with us via Open Humans will be stored on a server in the USA.</li>
                <li>The data from the survey will be stored at the RedCap server of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Both data sets will be used by the OPEN team for their research.</p>
