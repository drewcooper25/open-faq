            <h2>What is the purpose of your study?</h2>
            <p>We want to find out if the use of do-it-yourself artificial pancreas systems (DIYAPS; open source loop systems) has an influence on the health and well-being of people with diabetes. Additionally, we want to examine the challenges associated with building DIYAPS, and why some people choose not to use DIYAPS. </p>

            <h2>I am using a closed-loop system, but it is not DIY/open source. 
                I am not using any loop/do-it-yourself artificial pancreas system (DIYAPS).
                Can I participate in your study?</h2>
            <p>Yes! We are also looking for participants who are looping with a commercial loop and for participants who are not looping at all. Read more here: Who can participate…</p>

            <p>We are very sorry but it is not possible to participate on behalf of your child if they are younger than 2 years old. This is because certain questionnaires are not available for children this young.</p>

        <div class="scroll block block-openloop_diyaps">
            <h2>I am using a DIYAPS in open-loop mode. Can I participate?</h2>
            <p>Yes! If you haven't closed the loop (yet), you can still participate in our study. During the questionnaire, you will get the opportunity to specify the system you are using.</p>

        <div class="scrollblock block-survey_time">
            <h2>How much time will it take to complete the survey?</h2>
            <p>The time needed to complete the survey depends on the type of participant (e.g. less time for teenagers and partners). We have several, mostly very short questionnaires for you, but all in all it takes approximately 10 to 20 or 20 to 30 minutes. You can always have a break and come back to where you left off in the questionnaires. For this you will need your participant ID.</p>

        <div class="scrollblock block-participant_id">
            <h2>What is a participant ID?</h2>
            <p>The protection of your identity and data is very important to us. Our study is under the General Data Protection Guidelines (GDPR) mandated by the EU, ensuring maximum protection and personal control for participants over their information. As such, in order to keep you anonymous we do not ask for your real name, but generate a Participant ID.</p>
            <p>We ask you to write down, take a picture or email your Participant ID to yourself and keep it safe. You <strong>will</strong> need it later.</p>

                <li>Once you have completed the survey, if you would like to be personally informed about follow-up studies, we can message you without re-identifying you if you have an account on Open Humans and link it to our project. We have a How-to explanation here (link) on our website and within our survey.</li>
                <li>If you are interested in helping us take our research to the next level by combining your answers from the survey questionnaires with your health-related data, you can also “fill” your account on Open Humans with your CGM data and provide us access (see How-to below).</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Attention:</strong> Every time you upload new data you have to link your account with the OPEN project again if you want us to use the new data for our research.</p>

            <p>For this, it is important to know that you have to differentiate between the two different data sets that you can provide us with: The data we get from your answers at the survey questionnaires and the CGM/loop device data you share with us via Open Humans.</p>
            <p>The data from the survey will be stored at the RedCap server of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. The data uploaded to Open Humans will be stored on a server in the USA. GDPR…</p>
